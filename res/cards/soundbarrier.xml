    <shortDescription>Cpt C. Yeager in X-1 plane</shortDescription>
    <longDescription>On October 14, 1947, just less than a month after the U.S. Air Force had been created as a separate service, testings achieved their maximum with the first manned supersonic flight, piloted by Air Force Captain Charles ""Chuck"" Yeager in aircraft #46-062 that he had nicknamed Glamorous Glennis for his wife. This rocket-powered airplane was drop launched from the bomb bay of a modified B-29 Superfortress bomber, and it glided to a landing on the dry lake bed. XS-1 flight number 50 is the first one in which the X-1 recorded supersonic flight, at Mach 1.06 (700 miles per hour (1,100 km/h, 610 kn)).</longDescription>
