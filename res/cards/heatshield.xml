    <longDescription>The   first U.S. astronauts were selected in 1959, before human  spaceflight operations   began. NASA asked the military services to  provide a list of personnel who met   specific qualifications. After  stringent screening, NASA announced its selection  of seven men, all  pilots, as the first American astronauts. NASA has selected 20   more  groups of astronauts since the Original Seven. The backgrounds of  NASAs   latest group of Astronaut Candidates include schoolteachers, doctors, scientist, and engineers. NASA selects   astronauts from a diverse pool of applicants with a wide variety of backgrounds.From the thousands of  applications received, only a few are chosen for the   intensive  Astronaut Candidate training program. Including the Original Seven,   only 330 astronauts have been selected to date.The astronauts of the   21st century will continue to work aboard the International Space Station in cooperation with NASA 's international partners</longDescription>
