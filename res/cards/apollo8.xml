    <longDescription>The term "astronaut" derives from the Greek words meaning "space  sailor," and refers to all who have been launched as crew members aboard NASA spacecraft bound for orbit and beyond. Since the inception of  NASA's human space flight program, we have also maintained the term  "astronaut" as the title for those selected to join the NASA corps of  astronauts who make "space sailing" their career profession. The term  "cosmonaut" refers to those space sailors who are members of the Russian space program. The crew of each launched spacecraft is made up of  astronauts or cosmonauts drawn from various categories. The crew assignments and duties of commander, pilot, space  shuttle mission specialist, or International Space Station flight engineer are drawn from the NASA professional career astronauts. A special category of astronauts typically titled "payload specialist" refers to individuals selected and trained by commercial or research  organizations for flights of a specific payload on a space flight  mission. At the present time, these payload specialists may be  cosmonauts or astronauts designated by the international partners,  individuals selected by the research community, or a company or consortia flying a commercial payload aboard the spacecraft.</longDescription>
