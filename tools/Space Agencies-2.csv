Texte Long;The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) was a U.S. federal agency founded on March 3, 1915, to undertake, promote, and institutionalize aeronautical research. On October 1, 1958, the agency was dissolved, and its assets and personnel transferred to the newly created National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NACA was pronounced as individual letters, rather than as an acronym. Among other advancements, NACA research and development produced the NACA duct, a type of air intake used in modern automotive applications, the NACA cowling and several series of NACA airfoils which are still used in aircraft manufacturing.;"On October 14, 1947, just less than a month after the U.S. Air Force had been created as a separate service, testings achieved their maximum with the first manned supersonic flight, piloted by Air Force Captain Charles ""Chuck"" Yeager in aircraft #46-062 that he had nicknamed Glamorous Glennis for his wife. This rocket-powered airplane was drop launched from the bomb bay of a modified B-29 Superfortress bomber, and it glided to a landing on the dry lake bed. XS-1 flight number 50 is the first one in which the X-1 recorded supersonic flight, at Mach 1.06 (700 miles per hour (1,100 km/h; 610 kn)).";"On 17 July 1962, Major White flew the X-15 to an altitude of 314,750 feet (59 miles, 96 km). This qualified him for an Astronaut Badge, becoming the first ""Winged Astronaut"", and one of a few who have flown into space without a conventional spacecraft. Major Bob White was featured with a cover story in the August 3d, 1962 issue of LIFE magazine, detailing his July 17, 1962 flight.";;;;;;"The first major U.S. Government wind tunnel became operational
in 1921 and was located at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
(NACA), which became NASA Langley Research Center in 1958. This
wind tunnel was crude when compared to the tunnels used at NASA
Langley today. Like the aircraft tested in them, wind tunnels
evolve as researchers discover ways to more accurately duplicate
flight conditions.Wind tunnels help researchers understand the forces acting on an
object as it moves through the atmosphere. They are also used to
measure and minimize the noise produced by aircraft and to optimize
engine efficiency. Although primarily used for aircraft, other
objects such as spacecraft, automobiles, ships, trucks, and
wheelchairs have been tested in Langley wind tunnels.";"The   first U.S. astronauts were selected in 1959, before human 
spaceflight operations   began. NASA asked the military services to 
provide a list of personnel who met   specific qualifications. After 
stringent screening, NASA announced its selection  of seven men, all 
pilots, as the first American astronauts. NASA has selected 20   more 
groups of astronauts since the “Original Seven.” The backgrounds of 
NASA’s   latest group of Astronaut Candidates include schoolteachers, doctors, scientist, and engineers.
 NASA selects   astronauts from a diverse pool of applicants with a wide variety of backgrounds.   From the thousands of 
applications received, only a few are chosen for the   intensive  Astronaut Candidate training program. Including the “Original Seven”,   
only 330 astronauts have been selected to date.The astronauts of the   21st century will continue to
 work aboard the International Space Station in cooperation with NASA 's international partners; help to build and fly a new NASA   vehicle, the  Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) designed for human deep space  exploration; and further NASA’s efforts to partner with industry to   provide a commercial capability for space transportation to the space  station.";;A space rendezvous is an orbital maneuver during which two spacecraft, one of which is often a space station, arrive at the same orbit and approach to a very close distance (e.g. within visual contact). Rendezvous requires a precise match of the orbital velocities of the two spacecraft, allowing them to remain at a constant distance through orbital station-keeping. Rendezvous may or may not be followed by docking or berthing, procedures which bring the spacecraft into physical contact and create a link between them.The first attempt at rendezvous was made on June 3, 1965, when US astronaut Jim McDivitt tried to maneuver his Gemini 4 craft to meet back up with its spent Titan II launch vehicle's upper stage. Rendezvous was first successfully accomplished by US astronaut Wally Schirra on December 15, 1965. Schirra maneuvered the Gemini 6 spacecraft within 1 foot (30 cm) of its sister craft Gemini 7. The spacecraft were not equipped to dock with each other, but maintained station-keeping for more than 20 minutes.The first docking of two spacecraft was achieved on March 16, 1966 when Gemini 8, under the command of Neil Armstrong, rendezvoused and docked with an unmanned Agena Target Vehicle.;;"Kennedy Space Center was created for the Apollo manned lunar landing program,
 and has evolved to meet the changing needs of America's manned space 
program. Although such flights are currently on hiatus, KSC continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for the U.S. government's civilian space program from three pads at the adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Its Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) is the fourth-largest structure in the world by volume, and was the largest when completed in 1965. At NASA's creation in 1958, its launch operation was originally known as the Launch Operations Directorate (LOD), reporting to the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama. This consisted of a few buildings in the Industrial Area of Cape Canaveral Missile Test Annex, later known as Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) is an installation of the United States Air Force Space Command's 45th Space Wing, headquartered at nearby Patrick Air Force Base. Located on Cape Canaveral in the state of Florida, CCAFS is the primary launch head of America's Eastern Range with four launch pads currently active. Popularly known as ""Cape 
Kennedy"" from 1963 to 1973, and as ""Cape Canaveral"" from 1949 to 1963 
and from 1973 to the present, the facility is south-southeast of NASA's Kennedy Space Center on adjacent Merritt Island, with the two linked by bridges and causeways. The Cape Canaveral AFS Skid Strip provides a 10,000-foot (3,000 m) runway[6] close to the launch complexes for military airlift aircraft delivering heavy and outsized payloads to the Cape.
Many major American space exploration ""firsts"" were launched from CCAFS, including the first U.S. Earth satellite (1958), first U.S. astronaut (1961), first U.S. astronaut in orbit (1962), first two-man U.S. spacecraft (1965), first U.S. unmanned lunar landing (1966), and first three-man U.S. spacecraft (1968). It was also the launch site for the first spacecraft to ever fly past the other planets in the Solar System (1962–1977), the first spacecraft to orbit Mars (1971) and roam its surface (1996), the first American spacecraft to orbit and land on Venus (1978), the first spacecraft to orbit Saturn (2004), and to orbit Mercury (2011).";"NASA planners invented the term extra-vehicular activity in the early 1960s for the Apollo program to land men on the Moon, because the astronauts would leave the  spacecraft to collect lunar material samples and deploy scientific  experiments. To support this, and other Apollo objectives, the Gemini program was spun off to develop the capability for astronauts to work outside a two-man Earth orbiting spacecraft.The first American spacewalk was performed on June 3, 1965, by Edward H. White, II from the second manned Gemini flight, Gemini 4, for 21 minutes, on a 25-foot (7.6 m) tether. White was the first to control his motion in space with a Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit, which worked well but only carried enough propellant for 20 seconds. No EVAs were planned on the next three Gemini flights. The next EVA was planned to be made by David Scott on Gemini 8,  but that mission had to be aborted due to a critical spacecraft  malfunction before the EVA could be conducted. Astronauts on the next  three Gemini flights (Eugene Cernan, Michael Collins, and Richard Gordon), performed several EVAs, but none was able to successfully work for long periods outside the spacecraft without tiring and overheating. Finally, on November 13, 1966, Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin became the first to successfully work in space without tiring, on the Gemini 12
 last flight. Aldrin worked outside the spacecraft for 2 hours and 6  minutes, in addition to two stand-up EVAs in the spacecraft hatch for an additional 3 hours and 24 minutes. Aldrin's interest in scuba diving inspired the use of underwater EVA training to simulate weightlessness, which has been used ever since to allow astronauts to practice techniques of avoiding wasted muscle energy. The first EVA on the lunar surface was performed by Americans Neil Armstrong and Buz  Aldrin on July 21, 1969 (UTC), after the Apollo 11  Moon landing. This first Moon walk lasted 2 hours, 36 minutes. A total  of fifteen Moon walks were performed by members of six Apollo crews,  including Charles ""Pete"" Conrad, Alan Bean, Alan Shepard, Edgar Mitchell, David Scott, James Irwin, John Young, Charles Duke, Eugene ""Gene"" Cernan, and Dr. Harrison ""Jack"" Schmitt. Cernan was the last Apollo astronaut to step off the surface of the Moon.Charles Duke with a hammer on the lunar surface.The first EVA in deep space was made on August 5, 1971, by American Al Worden, to retrieve a film and data recording canister from the Apollo 15 Service Module
on the return trip from the Moon. Worden was assisted by James Irwin,  doing a standup EVA in the Command Module hatch. This was repeated by Ken Mattingly and Charles Duke on Apollo 16 and by Ronald Evans and Harrison Schmitt on Apollo 17.[4] The first EVA repairs of a spacecraft were made by Charles ""Pete"" Conrad, Joseph Kerwin, and Paul J. Weitz on May 26, June 7, and June 19, 1973, on the Skylab 2 mission. They rescued the functionality of the launch-damaged Skylab space station by freeing a stuck solar panel, deploying a solar heating shield, and freeing a stuck circuit breaker 
relay. The Skylab 2 crew made three EVAs, and a total of ten EVAs were  made by the three Skylab crews.They found that activities in weightlessness required about 2 1/2 times the duration as on Earth because many astronauts suffered spacesickness early in their flights.After Skylab, no more EVAs were made by the United States until the advent of the Space Shuttle program in the early 1980s. In this period, the Soviets resumed EVAs, making four from the Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 space stations between December 20, 1977, and July 30, 1982.";;"President Kennedy speaks before a crowd of 35,000 people at Rice University in the football field. The following are excerpts from his speech. "" ...We set sail on his new sea because there is a new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all people. ...Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war. But I do say space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistakes that man has made with extending his writ around this globe of ours. ...There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountian? Why - 35 years ago - why fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? We choose to go to the Moon, we choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one in which we intend to win, and the others too.""";;;"First space flight of the Apollo Program to carry astronauts into low Earth orbit.Crew :Walter M.
